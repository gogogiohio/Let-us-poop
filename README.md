# Let us poop 🐑💩

A real-time, motion-controlled multiplayer drawing experiment

This project is a browser-based interactive artwork where users control a pixel sheep using device motion (tilt). Movement leaves behind “poop” traces on a shared canvas, synchronized in real time across all connected users via Socket.IO.

The experience is designed primarily for mobile devices (iOS Safari recommended).
