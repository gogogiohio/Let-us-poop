# Let us poop 🐑💩

A real-time, motion-controlled multiplayer drawing experiment

This project is a browser-based interactive artwork where users control a pixel sheep using device motion (tilt). Movement leaves behind “poop” traces on a shared canvas, synchronized in real time across all connected users via Socket.IO.

The experience is designed primarily for mobile devices (iOS Safari recommended).

The project originally started while studying the drawing logic in Figure 01. I attempted to replace the mousePressed control used in Figure 02 with continuous data generated by a phone’s gyroscope. In this setup, device orientation values are read continuously and treated as sustained motion rather than a discrete trigger. When the values exceed a certain threshold (for example, if > 40), the x and y coordinates of a circle continuously increment on every frame, causing traces to be left over time.

During testing, I noticed that the resulting trace visually resembled something similar to “pooping,” as the system continuously leaves marks while moving. This unexpected visual quality led to the idea of developing a project where a small animal is controlled to “poop” while moving across the screen, using the phone’s gyroscope as the input.
